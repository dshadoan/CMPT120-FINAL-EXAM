# userDataManager.py

# this library was created to do the reading and writing functions for us, rather
# than using repetitive commands throughout the main project file.

# These functions included are used to manage stored data in a simple txt file iteration system

def loadUserData(filePath):
    userData = {} # initializes empty dictionary, stores the user data
    with open(filePath, "r") as file: # using with will automatically close the file once done reading information
        for line in file: # this loop will split the lines into 3 variables
            cardNumber, cardPin, cardBalance = line.strip().split(",")
            userData[cardNumber] = (cardPin, float(cardBalance))
    return userData

def writeUserData(filePath, userData): # guides where the updated balances will be written
    with open(filePath, "w") as file:
        for cardNumber, (cardPin, cardBalance) in userData.items():
            file.write(f"{cardNumber},{cardPin},{cardBalance}\n")
                # loads user data from a file into a dictionary
                # writes user data from dictionary to file
